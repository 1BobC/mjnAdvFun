    <div><h1>Modern Javascript exercises for variable scope to closure<br>Especially nested functions</h1>
        <h3>Variable scope, closure</h3>
        <p>A function can be created at any moment, passed as an argument to another function, and then called from a totally different place of code later.</p>
        <p>But what happens if outer variables change since a function is created? Will the function get newer values or the old ones?</p>
        <p>And what if a function is passed along as a parameter and called from another place of code, will it get access to outer variables at the new place?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Code blocks</h3>
        <p id= "bob1">An isolated code block does it's own thing!</p>
        <p>You can use the same variable declaration in seperate blocks</p>
        <p id= "bob2">One says 'Hello'</p>
        <p id= "bob3">The other 'Goodbye'</p>
        <p>There’d be an error without blocks. See jscript file for code without blocks - error, already declared!</p>
        <p id= "bob4">What will this show? Using the first variable name, message is: Hello</p>
        <p id= "bob5">What will this show? Using the same variable name, message is: error - redeclaration of let message</p>
        <p id= "bob6">if for while and so on, variables declared in {...} are also only visible inside:</p>
        <p>But when called outside the block we get ReferenceError for console and DOM.</p>
        <p id= "bob7">Similarly for for and while loops: this is an alert exercise incrementing to 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Nested functions</h3>
        <p id= "bob8">Here the nested function getFullName() is made for convenience. It can access the outer variables and so can return the full name.</p>
        <p>More Nested -  a nested function can be returned: either as a property of a new object 
        or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, 
        it still has access to the same outer variables.</p>
        <p>Answer is shown in alert window</p>
    </div>
    <div><h3>Explanation of functions - Lexical environment- worth a new div!</h3>
    <p>Step 1 variables... <p id= bob9a></p></p>
    <p>Step 2 function declarations (not function expressions)</p>
    <p>When a Lexical Environment is created, a Function Declaration immediately becomes a ready-to-use function (unlike let, that is unusable till the declaration)<p id= "bob9b"></p></p>
    <p>Step 3 inner and outer lexical environment...<p id= "bob9"></p></p>
    <p>Step 4 returning a function...See alert window showing the count. How does the counter remember the count?</p>
    <p>Info - Closure</p> 
    <p>When on an interview, a frontend developer gets a question about “what’s a closure?”, a valid answer would be a definition of the closure and an explanation that all functions in JavaScript are closures, and maybe a few more words about technical details: the [[Environment]] property and how Lexical Environments work.</p>
    <p>Closure Definition - A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In some languages, that’s not possible, or a function should be written in a special way to make it happen. But as explained above, in JavaScript, all functions are naturally closures (there is only one exception, to be covered in The "new Function" syntax, but not yet!).</p>  
    <p>Info - Garbage collection. Info - Real-life optimizations. See libre file Info - Modern Javascript garbage collection and nested functions</p>

    <div><h3>Exercises - Tasks - incudes solutions!</h3>
    <p>1 - Does a function pickup latest changes?</p>
    <p>2 - Which variables are available?</p>
    <p>3 - Are counters independent?</p>
    <p>4 - Counter object</p>
    <p>5 - Function in if</p>
    <p>6 - Sum with closures</p>
    <p>7 - Is variable visible?</p>
    <p>8 - Filter through function</p>
    <p>9 - Sort by field</p>
    <p>10 - Army of functions</p>
